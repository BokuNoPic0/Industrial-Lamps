# Industrial-Lamps
Industrial Craft 2 addon that adds EU-consuming light sources with a variety of colors. Made to be compatible with path tracing shaders, so each light source has different ID for on and off state. Configurable power consumption, internal capacity and light level. In order for lamps to work with SEUS PTGI, lumination blocks should be assigned to blocklight materials, and lanterns is only working when assigned to the torchlight materials (light sources with custom models).
